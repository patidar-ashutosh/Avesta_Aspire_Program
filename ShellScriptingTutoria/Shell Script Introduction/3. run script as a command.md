To create a shell script and make it accessible as a command, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Shell Script:**
   Write your shell script using a text editor and save it with a `.sh` extension. For example, create a file called `myscript.sh`.

   ```sh
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable:**
   Change the file permissions to make the script executable. You can do this using the `chmod` command.

   ```sh
   chmod +x myscript.sh
   ```

3. **Move the Script to a Directory in Your PATH:**
   Move the script to a directory that is included in your system's `PATH` environment variable. Common directories include `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin`.

   ```sh
   sudo mv myscript.sh /usr/local/bin/myscript
   ```


4. **Run Your Script as a Command:**
   You should now be able to run your script from any terminal session by simply typing its name.

   ```sh
   myscript
   ```
